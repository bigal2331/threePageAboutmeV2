				Hello, my name is Jeiner Noriega and I'm an aspiring Web Developer.
				I'm currently working for a non-profit managed long term care provider that services elderly and disabled individual. I have been learning how to program on my own for a few years now, but found it difficult to navigate the different online resources available. I have made it my goal to finally do it this year.
			</p>
			<p>
				I attended a bootcamp prep course administered by appAcademy earlier in the year and completed the FullStack academy prep-work before deciding to attend NYCDA.
